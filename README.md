# pokedex-js-app
This is an exerice in building a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

The API in question is https://pokeapi.co/ from which I sourced Pokemon attributes such as name, types, abilities, height, and images in order to display them in my pokedex.
